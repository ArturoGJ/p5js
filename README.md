# p5js projects and sketches

In this repository I have put most of the projects that I have done in p5.js, although they vary in complexity I do not think I need an individual repository for each one.

# Description for each project
## Clock
This project is just that, a Clock that displays time. 
What I very much like about this project is that I made it so everything in it resizes itself depending on the diameter of the clock, and that for the lines representing 5, 10, 20, 25, 35, 40, 50 and 55 minutes I used trigonometry so everything stays in the same place with the same direction, even though its not complex at all I thought it was pretty cool. 

## Piano
This project consists on displaying piano keys so that if you click on any of then you would hear the note corresponding to that key in particular. (you can also use a, s, d, f, g, h, j, and k to play)
I made this project to play arround with p5.js' sound library and used the corresponding frequencies of each note to play it.

## Redes (Networks in spanish)
I made this proyect for my Automotive Networks class in the university to display different types of bit codings depending on the input data. 
We were just supposed to draw them on a piece of paper and scan them but I thought I might just program it as well so it looks prettier.

## 'The Games'
## Snake
This one is not finished at all, it's not even halfway done but at least you can move a green square with the arrow keys, right?
I might finish it someday when I find enough time for this kind of proyects. 

## Tetris
This one is not finished either but what I have is pretty cool, It can draw all the different 'tetriminos' with different matix and each time you load it you get a random piece.
